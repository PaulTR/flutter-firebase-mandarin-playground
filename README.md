# Mandarin Chinese App

App for trying out different things in Flutter + Firebase. Concept is around learning/practicing Mandarin Chinese from English

## TODO

Firebase: 
- Add analytics
- Add crashlytics
- Look into database structure, find more efficient way to structure items
- Images that can match to sentences; pull examples from HSK practice exams
- Audio playback for questions via HSK practice exams

Flutter:
- Add page transitions with sent arguments
- Add table for dictionary
- Add matching page

Ideas:
- Look into audio recording to test against Google Cloud word translate - maybe speaking practice?
- Writing practice. ML handwriting recognition?
